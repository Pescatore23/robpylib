slayerOfLight=["I have come to unfold your mind","In my veins runs the poison wild","In the streams of mountains I flow","I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate","It will burn like the raging green flames","Inside a man dwell secrets so cold","Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans","I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands","The firewind rages in the sky","And my luminous sword hungers for more","I will leave no one alive","For I am the Slayer of Light","I... I will break your will","I... I will crush your faith","I... I will slay your dreams","I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart","I will tear it apart","I will pull everything with me under the surface","And all the screams will fade into my dreams","Fall now! Dying light!","I will burn away the ground beneath your feet","And all will be vanished in the darkness","Dying light! Fall now!","And let the night arrive"]

beyondTheDarkSun=['... For years I have travelled in coldness',"but my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...","Nothing can ever take away","what I've seen with these tired eyes","Face of the weeping night","and the shade of the fading light","The dawn will never rise again for my eyes","and I will never sleep again","I've lost my hope time after time","cause the light has vanished from the sky","Now when the darkness has become part of me","I got to let my shadows free","cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find","something that could have made me one","Now when the sorrow has taken control of me","I got to let my shadows free","cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find","something that could have made me one","something that I could reach the Sun"]

taleOfRevenge=['He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known','Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown','Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas','Of blood, crushing all his dreams','No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes','Devotion for death, now controls his life','No gold or silver can bring him consolation','Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge','One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone','One life so old and grey, wandering away from home','Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief','United by the sword of wicked screams','What deeds he has done to hear those dreadful sounds','In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound','Forever bound to death!','Wait for me in the mountains, haunt for me in the winds','Wait for me in the land where nothing lives','Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword','Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours']

ForesThatWeeps=['I am the mist in the morning','I am the moss in the ground','You are the light that cuts through the stone','I am the worms in the dirt','I am the branches reaching the sky','You are the source, the orchestrator of life','In the dark rain the gray mountains sing','A sad song of winter and the howling wind','Visions of the past in the haunting dreams','Under the dead sky, under the withered trees']
